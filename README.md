Learning ansible 

Setting up docker , kubernetes was rather easy.
while setting up docker i figured shell might not be the right way to work with as it rewrites the files whenever the command is executed. So i used apt and present command to do the same job and while at it , they dont rewrite the files.
Learning about ansible and os.hardening library did take a while.
Had some problems running ansible on python 2.7 so changed it to python 3.8
